# NBA-Analysis
I'm gathering NBA player data from Basketball Reference for current players.

## scrape.ipynb
- scrape player data from basketball-reference.com
- current players, game stats
- save as csv file

## nba.csv
- resulting csv file from scrape.ipynb




## Questions
What player measurements--accessible at basketball-reference.com--most accurately reflect player performance and impact?
- either per 36 mins or per 100 poss (probably possessions?)
- ORtg, DRtg
- true shooting %
- offenisve and defensive box +/-, or just box +/-
- win shares (total or per 48 mins); also offensive/defensive win shares

BPM is looking like a good measure. Could track win shares, and ts% as well. VORP is like BPM but accounts for playing time... look at this.
